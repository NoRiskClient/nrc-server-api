### Your idea

a small api for servers (could be private for now; should be publicly available at some point) that should be able to do (at least) the following things:

    * [ ]  See if player is using norisk client
      [ ]  Customize nametags (allow other colors than scoreboard team colors and multiple lines) low prio
      [ ]  Show a toast
      [ ]  Disable modules
      [ ]  Display (colored) beacon beams
      [ ]  Allow all colors for glowing effect
      [ ]  Set waypoints
      [ ]  Creating teams, similiar to [this](https://lunarclient.dev/apollo/developers/modules/team) low prio
      [ ]  OwO displays
      [ ]  Play emotes and Cosmetics for NPC


Platforms we should support:

     * [ ]  Fabric (very high priority, since we use it ourselves)
       [ ]  Paper (low priority; high if we release the api to the public)
       [ ]  Velocity (very low priority?)
       [ ]  Bungeecord (very very low priority!)
